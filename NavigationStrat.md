Navigation Strategy

## Status

Proposed


# Context

Linked 4 will be a connect 4-based mobile game. As such, navigation must be simplistic, intuitive and as non-intrusive as possible, so as to devote as much screen space and efficiency towards gameplay or other major features.


# Decision

The application will use drawer-style navigation paired with intuitive use of gestures. 
Consequences

# Consequence

As a result, using drawer navigation and the primary use of gestures allows the application to feature its gameplay and provide a cleaner, more focused experience for players. Using this method of navigation will, in addition, allow users to easily navigate between several of the applicationâ€™s screens using a compact interface that remains hidden during gameplay.
