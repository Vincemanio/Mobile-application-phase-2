UI Toolkit


## Status

Proposed


# Context

The group is employing React Native Elements, a UI framework for React Native, to create the smartphone game "Linked 4." Important factors that will improve the game's development and user experience will be enforced. Factors for change include the ability to play the game offline, minimal storage, picture storage and display, and music implementations.


# Decision

To create the game's UI, we will be using React Native as our toolbox. It makes UI creation more accessible, and we will personalize it to fit the style and aesthetic of our game.


# Consequences

React Native Elements makes UI creation easier by offering pre-made, easily customizable components. Players may play the game uninterrupted, even in places with spotty internet, thanks to offline gameplay, which improves the overall user experience.
